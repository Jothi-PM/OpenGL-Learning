This application is a real-time camera application that simulates the functionality of mobile camera app. It allows users to capture video streams and apply various filters in real-time. Currently it's tested on windows.

## Features

- **Real-Time Video Processing**: Captures video streams and processes them in real-time.
- **Filter Effects**: Apply a variety of filters to the video feed, similar to popular mobile camera apps.

## Dependencies

- OpenGL
- GLFW
- GLEW
- stb_image (optional)
- Other required libraries for image processing and rendering

## Usage

- Experiment with different effects to enhance the video feed.

## Future Enhancements

- Add mouse click support to switch between filters (high priority)
- Add more advanced filters.
- Support for saving photos and videos.
- Integration with external camera devices.
